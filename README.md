# Data Analysis Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository contains two projects where I've analyzed datasets related to job salaries and diamond prices. Each project is aimed at uncovering insights, trends, and patterns within the data.

## Projects

### 1. Job Salaries Analysis
In this project, I explored a dataset containing information about job salaries. Through data analysis and visualization techniques, I aimed to answer questions such as:

- What is the distribution of salaries across different job roles?
- Are there any correlations between years of experience and salary?
- How does education level affect salary?

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### 2. Diamond Prices Analysis
In this project, I delved into a dataset containing details about diamond prices. My analysis focused on understanding factors influencing diamond prices, including:

- How do the 4Cs (Carat, Cut, Clarity, Color) impact diamond prices?
- Are there any geographical trends in diamond pricing?
- How has diamond pricing evolved over time?

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
